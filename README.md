# Animal Vet System
This was an assignment for the paper Data Structures and Algorithms at Auckland University of Technology.

It is an animal vet system that uses a Heap to store the animals in a list to be seen by the vet organized by last seen date and priority level set by the veterinarian. Allows the ability to add pictures of the animals, save the current animals in the Heap to an XML to be loaded again.
